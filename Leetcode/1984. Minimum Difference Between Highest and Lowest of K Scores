Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.

class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int min= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int i=0, j=k-1;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        while(j<nums.length){
            int minLen=nums[i];
            int maxLen= nums[j];
            min= Math.min(min,maxLen-minLen);
            i++;
            j++;
            
        }
        return min;
    }
}
