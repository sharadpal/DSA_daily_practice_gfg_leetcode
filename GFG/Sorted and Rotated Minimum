A sorted array of distinct elements arr[] is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element in the array.



class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] arr) {
        // complete the function here
        int low=0, ans= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int high= arr.length-1;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid= (low+high)/2;
            if(arr[low]<=arr[mid]){
                ans= Math.min(ans,arr[low]);
                low= mid+1;
            }
            else{
                high= mid-1;
                ans= Math.min(ans,arr[mid]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
